Place logo images here for the site header.

Recommended filename for the header logo: genealogy-logo.png

- Copy your provided logo file to public/images/genealogy-logo.png
- It should be a small PNG or SVG. Aim for about 24-64px height; the layout will size it to h-6 (24px) by default.

If you prefer a different filename, update `app/layout.tsx` to point to the chosen path.
